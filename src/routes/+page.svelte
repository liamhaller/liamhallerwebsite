      <p class="space-y-5">I live in Berlin and I am a migration researcher at the 
        <a class="link" href="https://www.dezim-institut.de/en/institute/about-dezim/" target="_blank" >
          DeZIM institute</a>. My aim is to better understand migration decisions and outcomes

      My current research includes the the development of large-scale, agent-based simulations,
      the application of Bayesian methods, and the use of Markov chains to model forced migrant trajectories. 

    </p>

    <p>
      Previously, I was awareded a Fulbright research grant to to model the naturalization decision-making processes of forced migrants. 
       Before that, I worked as a software engineer at McMaster-Carr and conducted research in 
      combinatorics.

       I gratudated from Northwestern University, where I studied in mathemtatics and several 
       foreign langauges. 
       
       To varying degrees of fluency, I speak Arabic ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡¾ (shami/fausa), German ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª, French ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·,
       Hebrew ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡±, and Portuguese ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·. I also took masters-level coursework in finaincal economics through 
       the Kellogg certificate program.
