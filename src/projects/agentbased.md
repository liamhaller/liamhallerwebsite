This project <a href="https://www.dezim-institut.de/projekte/projekt-detail/neue-ansaetze-zur-simulation-von-zuwanderungs-und-integrationsverlaeufen-0-04/" target="_blank"><strong><u>[project website]</u></strong></a> aims to develop an agent-based model (ABM) to observe how complex, macro-level migration phenomena emerge from micro-level interactions between individuals within broader social and economic systems. A key goal is to study the counterfactual effects of migration policies (e.g., what if the Blue Card was never introduced or future policies become more restrictive). By documenting the modeling process, the project seeks to provide a practical guide for researchers and enhance the understanding of migration dynamics through computational simulations. Ultimately, the project aspires to inform policy decisions by revealing insights into how individual decisions aggregate into larger migration patterns.
