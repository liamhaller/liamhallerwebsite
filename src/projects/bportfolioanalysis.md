The application automatically calculates portfolio metrics across multiple accounts including beta, Value at Risk, and diversification scores using the Effective Number of Bets methodology. It tracks performance against the S&P 500, identifies optimal rebalancing opportunities based on target sector allocations, and generates reports with tax analysis including cost basis calculations and loss harvesting recommendations. The example is made from random trading data and code is not yet public.
