# Personal Website

Source code for my [personal website](https://www.liam-haller.com/), built using SvelteKit, Tailwind CSS and hosted on Vercel.

 To develop, run:

```sh-session
$ npm install
$ npm run dev
```
The layout for this website was inspired by [Eric Zhang](https://github.com/ekzhang/ekzhang.github.io)
